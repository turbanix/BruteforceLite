# BruteforceLite
A simple number bruteforcer.

# How this works:
You enter a number thats between 1 to 32767 (that is the maximum limit for %random%, with is the signed 16 bit integer limit), then you press any key to start it. When its done, it will save as log in the log folder.

# *THIS IS IMPORTANT*
i dont even know if this works lol (but its a fast program... so it might not work.)
